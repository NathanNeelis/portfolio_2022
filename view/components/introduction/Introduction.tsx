                        Hello <span>ðŸ‘‹</span> my name is Nathan. Iâ€™m learning to be a web
                        developer and user experience designer at the university of
                        applied sciences. My home studio is based in Alkmaar, here I spend
                        most of my hours studying. A few years ago I decided to quit my
                        graphical design job and start learning about the digital world.
                        Nowadays I can create applications and look at the user needs.
